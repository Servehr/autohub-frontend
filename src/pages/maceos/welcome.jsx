We recommend that everyone who is in the automobile industry enrols for our Academy and such a person’s life will never be the same. We also recommend our Academy to those who are not into the automobile industry because the courses therein have the potential to change the state of any business exponentially.

                                                        To harness and propel the automobile industry, we must raise great individuals who are experienced and passionate about changing the industry in the areas of innovation, utilization, modernization and expansion. As a wake-up call, we are equipping intending and established automobile CEOs to be contemporary, innovative and successful.

The industry cuts across automotive, aviation, maritime, artificial intelligence and space exploration.

                                                        We have invested years of hard work to come up with the type of course materials that we have in our Academy. We discovered through a narrow lens that for the automobile industry to thrive in Africa with incredible innovations, there is a need for the education of personnel who have an interest in the industry. 
                                                        This education is not for engineering nor the invention of automotive products, rather, it’s to equip students to understand the business in the industry, the innovative diversity, opportunities therein, management and how futuristic. Meanwhile, we will teach students the elementary aspects of automobile engineering and other related automobile inventions.

                                                        MACEOS Academy has static and dynamic sections. The static section works with the standard curriculum. To put it differently, the static section maintains the six-months academic section and follows up on the timetable. 
                                                        <br />We have nine courses in total with each having sub-courses, and sub-courses, modules. Each course lasts for two weeks which brings it to a total of 18 weeks (four months, two weeks). The remaining six weeks are for four weeks of live lectures and interactions, and two weeks for examinations.
                                                        <br />The first step that a student will take is to apply for admission into the Academy. After the application, we will review it and grant you admission upon qualification. This comes after we must have confirmed the payment of your admission fee.

                                                        Dynamic Section is not fixed. We made this available for those who might not meet up with our academic timetable. As the name applies, the dynamic section allows a student to determine when he or she will graduate. It allows the student to choose when to demand for course materials, tutor mark assignments (TMA), and examinations. 
                                                        However, dynamic section cannot exceed two years. We shall rusticate any student that exceeds two years under dynamic section.
